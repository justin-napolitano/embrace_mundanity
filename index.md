## Why

Life is hard enough. Do not chase glory.

### What do I mean

Life is hard enough. Every single act within my daily life is incredibly difficult.  I am nearly 30 years old and still have to force myself to brush my teath every day, to shower, to eat a few square meals a day.  These little daily tasks that are truly important to our health and wellbeing are by far the most difficult and sometimes the least prioritized.  

### What should I do

I don't know. I always say this, but I really do not know. I do not think I can define simple maxim to follow in every situation. I would love for life to be that simple... but I know in reality that there are many externalities often beyond my control... but what can I can control? 

### My daily tasks

#### Morning routine

##### What is my actual routine

1. I check my phone for the time
2. I stop myself from reading messages
3. I close my eyes again 
4. I wake up an hour later
5. I use the restroom
6. I wash my face
7. I brush my teeth
8. I make my hair
9. I down a cup a coffee
10. I catch up on messages
11. I read the news
12. I start tackling the tasks I have to do to maintain my quality of life


##### What would I like my routine to be

1. I jump out of bed at the crack of dawn.
2. I drop and do 100 pushups
3. I do 100 squats
4. I run 2 miles. 
5. I shower.
6. I do the usual washing and tidying routine. 

##### Why do I not accomplis my ideal

I've become accustomed to my lazy routine. I have accepted it. I like it. 

##### Can I change my moring routine

Yeah... BUt how.

Well, I have a cat that keeps me from sleeping well. I should go to bed around 9 or 10 so I can wake up earlier when the cat starts playing.  This works, but I want to spend my evenings with friends which conflicts with going to bed early. I gotta choose which is more important to me. 

I can put my phone away and use a watch or an old school alarm clock. Thats probably it. I have to move my phone. It just sucks out the soul. 

Without the phone the rest will fall in line. Reading the news is a horrible habit that just feeds that part of my brain that loves gossip. That is all the news is. What can i really do about it? 

#### Daily routine

I keep lists of tasks that need to be completed. I write notes to help me finsih them and keep up to date with their status. It works pretty well actually, but I do find myself acting without mindfulness throughout the day. I try to just knock out my tasks, but do not really approach them with a clear mind.  I need to work on this.  

##### How do I change this up

I think I really need to pin point the things I do often and improve upon them. I need to drill the technique of getting in/out of a car... I need to drill how I sit in public. I need to drill how enter/exit my home. These little things, these mundane tasks can be optimized to improve my quality of life and to decrease my stress. I do not really do this, because well I am set in my ways. I need to stop and try. I hate to try, but it must be done.  


## What is the point of writing this

Well, there is no point really. I am at a coffee shop trying to kill some time. I am reflecting on my day. On the little stressful moments throughout the day. Most of them are my fault. I truly act according the example of the people who tutored me. I still feel anxiety when I write notes because I imagine Sister Dorothy chastising me for writing above the line... and of course I write above that line.  I feel like my uncle telling me not to be a fag (this is a direct quote I do not wish to offend) when drinking from a straw.  I feel anxious in crowds.. I feel a need to prove myself to random people.  I am afraid of being hit by most men.. These little things that my parents and family and tutors impressed upon me cause incredible amounts of stress in my daily life. 

I do not want to feel that stress. I think I am going to make a point to analyze myself in order to relieve some of the stress I feel when trying to perform basic --I mean really basic- things.  

What was written above is a precursor to more things to come.... to posts actually reviewing the mundane thigns that I need to focus on in order to improve my wellbeing.
