I built "Embrace Mundanity" as a personal project to tackle the everyday struggles we all face. You know the drill: juggling daily tasks, maintaining mental well-being, and that nagging sense of disconnect between what we want to do and what we actually achieve. 

## Why This Project Exists

Life's routine can get monotonous, but it's also where we often find ourselves. I wanted to create a space to explore those thoughts, both the highs and lows. This project serves as a mirror for my daily life, spotlighting the challenges and offering a laid-back way to reflect on the chaos of simple existence. 

- **Personal Narrative**: It's all about raw honesty. I dive into my routines and struggles and lay it all out.
- **Exploration of Mental Health**: I reflect on how daily tasks impact my well-being and vice versa.
- **Challenge vs. Reality**: I juxtapose what I aim to accomplish with what actually happens day-to-day.

## Key Design Decisions

I chose a simple, no-frills approach to keep the focus where it belongs—on the content. Here’s how I structured it:

- **Markdown Format**: Using markdown (in `index.md`) allows for easy readability and flexibility. Plus, it’s compatible with various static site generators, so anyone can set it up quickly.
- **Organized Sections**: I broke the content into clear sections. This makes it easier to navigate through my current habits, my ideal routines, and my reflections. I wanted to make it a bit like journaling but structured enough to provide a constant reference point.

## Tech Stack

Here’s what fuels this project:

- **Markdown**: All the text and reflections are in markdown. It simplifies everything.
- **Static Site Compatibility**: It's designed with the assumption that you'll want to use it with a static site generator like Hugo or Jekyll down the line.

## Getting Started

Want to dive in? It's pretty straightforward:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/embrace_mundanity.git
   cd embrace_mundanity
   ```
2. **Open the Markdown File**: Just fire up any markdown viewer or editor and check out `index.md`.
3. **(Optional) Go Static**: If you’re feeling frisky, use a static site generator to turn those markdown notes into a slick website. 

The project structure looks like this:

```
embrace_mundanity/
└── index.md       # Main content file where all the magic happens
```

Inside `index.md`, I’ve included frontmatter for the title, description, author, and tags. It gives a neat overview ready for presentation.

## Tradeoffs

Now, let’s get real about the downsides. 

- **Single Entry**: Right now, it's just one markdown file. While it captures my thoughts, there's a limit to what I can express in a single piece.
- **No Interactive Features**: There’s a lack of functionality for tracking or visualizing routines over time. The project is static as it stands.
- **Overly Simplistic**: Some might argue that it doesn’t do enough. But for me, keeping it simple is part of the reason it works.

## Future Work / Roadmap

I have big plans for this repository. Here's what I'm itching to improve:

- **Expand Content**: I want to add more detailed reflections or broaden the focus to include additional daily routines.
- **Multiple Entries**: It would be great to implement a system for tracking multiple journaling entries over time.
- **Improved Presentation**: Integrating with a static site generator would elevate the user experience significantly. 
- **Automation**: Future integrations might include tools that track or visualize my routines for a clearer picture of progress.

## Conclusion 

“Embrace Mundanity” is a small but meaningful step toward understanding my daily life and mental health. I believe that sharing these reflections—no matter how mundane—might resonate with others on a similar journey. 

If you want to see how this project evolves, I share updates on Twitter/X, Bluesky, and Mastodon. Join me on this little adventure, and who knows? Maybe together we can tackle the everyday grind.
